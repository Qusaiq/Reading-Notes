# Computers can be found anywhere in our life:
>- on our desktop 
>-  Homes 
>- our pockets 
>> To know how do computers work we have to know **what makes a computer a computer** then  **we look at how information is represented inside a computer using tiny signals** after that **we learn how computer use circuits that dose everything from doing simple math to simulating virtual worlds** then **we zoom out to the different parts of the computer (Input, Output, CPU, Memory) that store all the information** finally **we look at what codes are and how software controls over hardware.**

# What's the difference between hardware and software? 
>> The beauty of a computer is that it can run a word-processing program one minute—and then a photo-editing program five seconds later. In other words, although we don't think of it this way, the computer can be reprogrammed as many times as you like. This is why programs are also called software. They're "soft" in the sense that they are not fixed: they can be changed easily. By contrast, a computer's hardware—the bits and pieces from which it is made (and the peripherals, like the mouse and printer, you plug into it)—is pretty much fixed when you buy it off the shelf. The hardware is what makes your computer powerful; the ability to run different software is what makes it flexible. That computer can do so many different jobs is what makes them so useful—and that's why millions of us can no longer live without them!
