#  HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### **Links**:-

- Links are created using the 'a' element.
- The 'a' element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative 
links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" 
field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be 
linked to.

### **Layout**:-

- ***Building Blocks*** CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. 
This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
   1. Block-level elements start on a new line  Examples include: 'h1'  'p'  'ul'  'li'.
     2. Inline elements flow in between surrounding  text Examples include:  'img'  'b'  'i'.
- ***Containing Elements*** If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent 
element.
- CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout 
of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You 
specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also 
float elements using the float property.
- div elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections 
of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or 
fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be 
used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.) .
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is 
about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### ***JS***:-

***Basic instructions:-***

- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in 
a recipe.
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that 
a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the 
script.
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related 
information.
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean 
values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

***Functions*** let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse 
the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

***Function Syntax***

function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}

***Why Functions?***

- You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
- You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce 
different results.

### ***Pair Programming***:-

***Pair programming*** is an agile software development technique in which two 
programmers work together at one workstation.

***Why pair program?***

- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills 
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness
