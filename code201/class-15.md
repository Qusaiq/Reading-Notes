# What Google Learned About Teams


After years of analyzing data and interviews from more than 180 teams across the company, Google found that the kinds of people (a.k.a. the individual personalities) in a team are not so relevant.
Instead, the researchers found that there were five key characteristics of enhanced teams:-



1. ### ***Psychological Safety***

- Psychological safety is about environment. It's about creating a safe culture in which team members feel "safe" enough 
to  take an interpersonal risk. Encouraging team members to voice their opinions, even if it goes against the group, can 
be  risky. However, teams that exhibit high psychological safety encourage risk-taking. Plus, when team members take 
risks, they aren't viewed as disruptive, disrespectful or incompetent.

- When teams promote psychological safety, there is a free flow of ideas, which can lead to better outcomes. You can ask 
for help without fear of retribution or adverse impact to your reputation. Team members feel comfortable asking questions 
and sharing opinions, which can lead to healthy debate and help the team thrive.



2. ### ***Dependability***

- Dependability is about accountability. It's about reliability. It's about trust.

- When everyone on the team is accountable, reliable and trustworthy, the team succeeds.

- How many teams have you been on when one person shirks responsibility? We've all seen it before. A team can crumble 
when even one person can't be trusted to do the work. On a highly dependable team, every team member can trust that high 
quality work will be produced on time.



3. ### ***Structure and clarity***

- All teams need structure and clarity, so long as rules are not too rigid that they stifle progress.

- When teams have structure and clarity, there are specific and clear performance standards and directives for the team 
to work and achieve. With these inputs, team members understand their function, purpose, expectations and performance 
objectives.

- With structure and clarity, specificity is key. Team members will thrive when they have goals that are clear, specific 
and transparent so they know what is expected of them. For example, at Google, Objectives and Key Results (OKR's) are a 
management tool used to establish and communicate both long-term and short-term goals. Some teams even establish a common 
vocabulary to start introducing norms that reflect the team identity.



4. ### ***Meaning***

- No one wants to work in a job or organization without meaning or purpose. So, you can imagine how a team member feels 
working on a team without either meaning or purpose. There are many ways to create meaning within the construct of a 
team. For example, you can create meaning in the work itself or in the final product.

- Google found that other ways to create meaning in work include creating financial security, supporting one's family, 
helping the team succeed, or exhibiting self-expression.



5. ### ***Impact***

- Work is about creating value and impact for others. Team members want to know - from their subjective perspective - 
that the work they are doing is creating impact. Also, team members want to feel that the team's work is helping to 
advance the organization's overall goals, mission and impact. Reserving time for each team member to reflect on their 
impact can be a valuable exercise to further purpose and meaning as well.
