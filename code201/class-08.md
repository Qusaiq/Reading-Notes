# CSS Layout

**Layout**:-

- ***Building Blocks*** CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. 
This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
   1. Block-level elements start on a new line  Examples include: 'h1'  'p'  'ul'  'li'.
     2. Inline elements flow in between surrounding  text Examples include:  'img'  'b'  'i'.
- ***Containing Elements*** If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent 
element.
- CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout 
of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You 
specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also 
float elements using the float property.
- div elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections 
of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or 
fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be 
used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.) .
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is 
about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
