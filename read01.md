text editor's i have to choice wisely my text editor depend on what i really need or what i fell comfortable with  like the auto complete and the syntax highlights they all do the job but its more than that for a developer 
but in general a text editor is more helpful and readable than the editors that comes with the operating system , personally i'll go with visual studio or notepad++ .
