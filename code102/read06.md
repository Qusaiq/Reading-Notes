### How to add CSS to HTML:-
* Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
* Internal - by using a < style> element in the < head> section
* External - by using a < link> element to link to an external CSS file

#### Example:-

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 20px;
}

### Notes:-

* In CSS color can be set by using the colors name 
* CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, 
separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
