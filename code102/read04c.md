# An overview on HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT

**HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript**.
**CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout**.
**JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements**.

## PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT:

*These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building 
web pages called progressive enhancement*.
* HTML ONLY Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the 
most important thing about your site: it is content.
* HTML+CSS Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules 
regarding how the page looks away from the content itself.
* HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT The JavaScript is added last and enhances the 
usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.

## LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE:

*When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML 
script element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its 
re-attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.*

## How do I write a script for a web page?

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. 
JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), 
but they have the. js extension.
* The HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser 
to load the JavaScript file (rather like the link element can be used 
to load a CSS file).
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the 
JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works 
with the model of the web

## JavaScript:

Note: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semi-colon 
(;)

## JavaScript Statements:

JavaScript statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE?

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
In this example, x, y, and z are variables, declared with the var 
keyword:
Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. 
You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (=)
, followed by the value you want to give it. For example:
myName = 'X';
myAge = 37;
