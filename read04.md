# ID attribute 

Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page 

#### example

# Class Attribute

Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document

# Block Elements

Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.

# Inline Elements

Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements

# Grouping Text & Elements In a Block

> < div>

The < div > element allows you to
group a set of elements together
in one block-level box
